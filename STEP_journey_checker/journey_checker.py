"""
Implementation of the algorithm to check a journey.

It starts by looking public transports using GTFS files and then deduce
private mode of transports. This is the first part.
Next, for each part of the journey we do a specific treatment :

- if it's a public transport we don't do anything more because we already found 
the line. It would be necessary to use realtime data to check trips on bus to 
distinguish from cars, but realtime data handling is more complex and need 
more work especially to ensure reproductible results with tests.

- if it's a private transport we use a classification algorithm except if it's
a car since we don't need to check that. For now, the bayesian method has 
given the best results so we'll use it.
