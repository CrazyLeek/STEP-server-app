    A trip classifier that use the Bayes' formula.

    It is configured to classify the trips into three categories : walk, bike
    and other. It takes as a parameter a file of statistics which give for the 
    three categories the probability of being in a speed intervall. There are 
    intervalls for every 2 km/h starting from 0 and ending at 46. If a speed is 
    greater than 46, we consider the speed equal to 46. These element give the 
    meaning of the _speed_to_index method. These intervalls are probably not 
    the best and could be changed but the method gives good result so there is 
    no emergency. Other comment : the sum of the numbers in a column should be 
    equal to 1 but in pratice it's not the case as it doesn't raise any other
